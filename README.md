# Wake-Aerodynamics
In this lab, we analyzed the wake behind a cylinder and Clark Y-14 airfoil in a low-speed subsonic wind tunnel data from 120 individual experiments (including my group's).


Experimental Data
-------------

Each experiment produced a data file containing data from the test section's freestream as well as total pressure data from a pitot tube placed behind the body at varying coordinates. From this total pressure data, we get the velocity in the wake and hence velocity deficit.
